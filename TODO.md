In this file, we'll have some various todo items for the project. Those wil
be broken up into 3 groups: known issues/bugs, concrete improvement ideas,
and feature requests.

## Known Issues/ Bugs

* App crashes when there are songs that are present in it's library that no 
longer exist on the phone.
* Toasts (those little pop ups at the bottom of the screen) are too slow to 
actually convey information to the user during tap-input.
* Write unit tests, lol

## Improvement ideas

* Reject outling taps in the tap-input to get a better measurements
* Change the screen's during tap-input to let the user know when the input
song has changed
* Display the current input song during tap-input

on that screen
